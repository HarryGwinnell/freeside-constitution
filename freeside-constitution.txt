  BACKGROUND

  Freeside is a student run non-profit organisation that was created in the
  late 1990s. Many students have taken the role of leadership for the
  organisation, some leaderships ending in disaster for the group and others
  allowing it to thrive. This constitution is being written to ensure that a
  fair and well-functioning leadership will be given to Freeside for the
  foreseeable future. It also serves as a record of ethical conduct within
  the group.
